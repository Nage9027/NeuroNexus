#NeuroNexus #WebDevelopment #Internship
This repository contains my project submissions for the Web Development Internship at NeuroNexus Innovations.

The tasks showcase the use of fundamental web development skills, including creating a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS.

The work reflects dedication to professional growth and hands-on practice in building structured, user-friendly web forms without using JavaScript.
